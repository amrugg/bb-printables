(3) It is to one's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel. (4) Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing. (5) The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out. (6) Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find? (7) The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them. (8) When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes. (9) Who can say, \"I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin\"? (10) Differing weights and differing measures--the LORD detests them both. (11) Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright? (12) Ears that hear and eyes that see--the LORD has made them both. (13) Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare. (14) \"It's no good, it's no good!\" says the buyer--then goes off and boasts about the purchase. (15) Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel. (16) Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. (17) Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel. (18) Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance. (19) A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much. (20) If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness. (21) An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end. (22) Do not say, \"I'll pay you back for this wrong!\" Wait for the LORD, and he will avenge you. (23) The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him. (24) A person's steps are directed by the LORD. How then can anyone understand their own way? (25) It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one's vows. (26) A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them. (27) The human spirit is the lamp of the LORD that sheds light on one's inmost being. (28) Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure. (29) The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old. (30) Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being.",

(3) When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. (4) Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, \"Look at us!\" (5) So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. (6) Then Peter said, \"Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.\" (7) Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. (8) He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. (9) When all the people saw him walking and praising God, (10) they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. (11) While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. (12) When Peter saw this, he said to them: \"Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? (13) The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. (14) You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. (15) You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. (16) By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see. (17) \"Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. (18) But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. (19) Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, (20) and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you--even Jesus.",
