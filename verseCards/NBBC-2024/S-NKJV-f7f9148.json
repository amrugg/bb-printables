But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, \"Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.\" (17) Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed. (18) Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him. (19) Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. (20) And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, \"Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?\" (21) Then Daniel said to the king, \"O king, live forever! (22) \"My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.\" (23) Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God. (24) And the king gave the command, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions--them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den.

(15) Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my decease. (16) For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
