(11) Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; (12) if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; (13) if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself. (14) Keep reminding God's people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. (15) Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. (16) Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. (17) Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, (18) who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. (19) Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: \"The Lord knows those who are his,\" and, \"Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.\"",
