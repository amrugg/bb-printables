(17) Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. (18) And when they came to him, he said to them: \"You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, (19) serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; (20) how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, (21) testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. (22) And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, (23) except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. (24) But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. (25) And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. (26) Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, (27) for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. (28) Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. (29) I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; (30) and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. (31) Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. (32) And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. (33) I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. (34) You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. (35) In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\" (36) And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.",

(6) The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers them. (7) The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand. (8) A man is commended according to his good sense, but one of twisted mind is despised. (9) Better to be lowly and have a servant than to play the great man and lack bread. (10) Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel. (11) Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense. (12) Whoever is wicked covets the spoil of evildoers, but the root of the righteous bears fruit. (13) An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips, but the righteous escapes from trouble. (14) From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good, and the work of a man's hand comes back to him. (15) The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice. (16) The vexation of a fool is known at once, but the prudent ignores an insult. (17) Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence, but a false witness utters deceit. (18) There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. (19) Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment. (20) Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but those who plan peace have joy. (21) No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble. (22) Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, but those who act faithfully are his delight. (23) A prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaims folly. (24) The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor. (25) Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad. (26) One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. (27) Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth. (28) In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death.",

(18) With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.

(7) Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. (8) And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. (9) As it is written, \"He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.\" (10) He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.

(5) Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. (6) And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day-- (7) just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. (8) Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones. (9) But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, \"The Lord rebuke you.\" (10) But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively. (11) Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion. (12) These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted; (13) wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever. (14) It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, \"Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, (15) to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\" (16) These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage. (17) But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. (18) They said to you, \"In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.\" (19) It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.
