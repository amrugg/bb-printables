(5) God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. (6) For he saith to the snow, Be thou <i>on</i> the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. (7) He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

(10) By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. (11) Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: (12) And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.

(2) And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. (3) And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. (4) And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: (5) And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? (6) He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, (7) Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. (8) And they remembered his words, (9) And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. (10) It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i>the</i> <i>mother</i> of James, and other <i>women</i> <i>that</i> <i>were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles. (11) And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. (12) Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. (13) And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i>about</i> threescore furlongs. (14) And they talked together of all these things which had happened. (15) And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i>together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. (16) But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. (17) And he said unto them, <q>What</q> <q>manner</q> <q>of</q> <q>communications</q> <i><q>are</q></i> <q>these</q> <q>that</q> <q>ye</q> <q>have</q> <q>one</q> <q>to</q> <q>another,</q> <q>as</q> <q>ye</q> <q>walk,</q> <q>and</q> <q>are</q> <q>sad?</q> (18) And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? (19) And he said unto them, <q>What</q> <q>things?</q> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:",
