(2) And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it. (3) His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. (4) And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men. (5) But the angel answered and said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. (6) \"He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. (7) \"And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.\" (8) So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word. (9) And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, \"Rejoice!\" So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. (10) Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.\" (11) Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. (12) When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, (13) saying, \"Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.' (14) \"And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and make you secure.\" (15) So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. (16) Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. (17) When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted. (18) And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, \"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. (19) \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) \"teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" Amen.",

(3) For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing, (4) imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. (5) And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God. (6) So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. (7) But as you abound in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us--see that you abound in this grace also. (8) I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. (9) For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich. (10) And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; (11) but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to desire it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have. (12) For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have. (13) For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened; (14) but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack--that there may be equality. (15) As it is written, \"He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.\" (16) But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. (17) For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord.
