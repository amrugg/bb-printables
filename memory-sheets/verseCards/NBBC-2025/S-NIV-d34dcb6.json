(16) Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. (17) From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. (18) When they arrived, he said to them: \"You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. (19) I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents. (20) You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. (21) I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. (22) \"And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. (23) I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. (24) However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me--the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace. (25) \"Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. (26) Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. (27) For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. (28) Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. (29) I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. (30) Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. (31) So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears. (32) \"Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. (33) I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. (34) You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. (35) In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' \" (36) When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.",

(3) No one can be established through wickedness, but the righteous cannot be uprooted. (4) A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones. (5) The plans of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful. (6) The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them. (7) The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous stands firm. (8) A person is praised according to their prudence, and one with a warped mind is despised. (9) Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant than pretend to be somebody and have no food. (10) The righteous care for the needs of their animals, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel. (11) Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies have no sense. (12) The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers, but the root of the righteous endures. (13) Evildoers are trapped by their sinful talk, and so the innocent escape trouble. (14) From the fruit of their lips people are filled with good things, and the work of their hands brings them reward. (15) The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice. (16) Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent overlook an insult. (17) An honest witness tells the truth, but a false witness tells lies. (18) The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. (19) Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment. (20) Deceit is in the hearts of those who plot evil, but those who promote peace have joy. (21) No harm overtakes the righteous, but the wicked have their fill of trouble. (22) The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy. (23) The prudent keep their knowledge to themselves, but a fool's heart blurts out folly. (24) Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in forced labor. (25) Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up. (26) The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. (27) The lazy do not roast any game, but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt. (28) In the way of righteousness there is life; along that path is immortality.",

(9) The schemes of folly are sin, and people detest a mocker. (10) If you falter in a time of trouble, how small is your strength!

Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done? (13) Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.

Entirely on their own, (4) they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people. (5) And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us. (6) So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. (7) But since you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you--see that you also excel in this grace of giving. (8) I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. (9) For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich. (10) And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. (11) Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. (12) For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have. (13) Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.

The goal is equality, (15) as it is written: \"The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.\" (16) Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. (17) For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. (18) And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.

(7) In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (8) In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. (9) But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, \"The Lord rebuke you!\" (10) Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct--as irrational animals do--will destroy them.

(12) These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead.
